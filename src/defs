class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
It represents the set of properties or methods that are all common to all objects of one type.
uses: using classes you can create multiple objects with the same behaviour instead of writing code multiple.


class is a blueprint of objects
object it is an instanciation of a class
when a class is defined no memory space is allocated in the menory during the runtime of the class,
when ever we define the object under the class then instanciation will take place, it means some memory space will be occupied in the class
during the run-time of the code against the objects as we are going to define under the class.
Synatax of the class
class className{
//Member varibale
//Member Functions
}

member variables are there to store the data of the same or different datatypes member functions are what are the different operations that
we can carryout on those data.
class will contain member variables and member functions.members can be accessed throughout the entire class and sometimes from the outside of the class.


OBJECTS: Objects are the instances of the defined class type.
when a class is created no memeory is allocated where as when an object is created then memory is allocated.
we can say that class is an userdefined datatypes and objects are the variables of that type.
in JAVA we need to initalize the object with the keyword 'new'
SYNATX: className objectName = newclassName();
